  <strong style="font-size: 30px; color: black"> A</strong>lhamdulillah. In the Name of Allâh, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful 
  
  <h2 style="color: red"> In Short and Summarise - </h2>
If such an offer is received,
<br></br>
"For every step, one year of Nafal fasting, and one year of Nafal prayer will be written in our record."
Will we miss anyone? Certainly not!
</br></br>
If you participate in the Friday prayer through 5 acts on Friday, Allah Ta'ala gives the reward of one year of Nafal fasting and one year of Nafal prayer step by step. Subhanallah!!!
</br></br>
That is, if the distance from one's house to the mosque is 100 steps, then by doing these five things, that person will get the reward of 100 years of Nafal fasting and 100 years of Nafal prayers.
</br></br>
The five tasks are:
</br>
1. Take a bath<br>
2. Come to the mosque first</br>
3. Walking to the mosque</br>
4. Sitting near the imam.</br>
5. Listen to the sermon carefully</br> without talking in vain.</br></br>

On the authority of Aaws Ibn Aaws As-Saqfi Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu: He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam say:
</br></br>
"He who performs ablution on Jumu'ah and bathes (his wife also), wakes up tomorrow and wakes up (early and early and gets ready (to go to the mosque)), goes to the Masjid on foot and not by car for Jumu'ah. And he will sit near the Imam and listen to the Khutbah without saying any useless words, every step he takes (going to the Masjid) will be considered as Sunnah and for every step he will get the reward of fasting for one year and praying all night.
</br></br>
- Sahih Abu Dawood 345
</br></br>
The female members of our family, who cannot attend Juma'ah. For them, the scholars suggest that they should encourage and encourage the men of the house to do these deeds. By assisting men in these good deeds, inshallah women can also share in this reward.
<h3>Some more Sunnah supported acts of Friday:</h3>

- Take a shower</br>
</br>
- Recitation of Surah - Sajda and Surah Dahr/Insan in Fajr obligatory prayer
</br></br>
- Dress well
</br></br>
- Using perfumes</br></br>

- Going to the mosque first</br></br>

- Recitation of Surah Kahf (any time from Thursday sunset to Friday sunset)
</br></br>
- Praying at least two rakats in the mosque during Jumu'ar Salat
</br></br>
- Making dua between two sermons. Dua is accepted at this time. - Also make dua as much as possible throughout the day
</br></br>
- Read more prayers
</br></br>
- Listening to Khutbah attentively, not talking during Khutbah or doing any useless work.
</br></br>
- Being busy on the mobile phone and even running the donation box of the mosque at this time is also included in the futile work. Even if someone is forbidden to speak during the sermon, it is considered a futile act. And if you do useless things during the sermon, it makes Jumu'ah blessed. Therefore, one should refrain from all activities except listening to the sermon. Donation box of the mosque cannot be opened at this time. Donation boxes can be run before the sermon or after the prayer.
</br></br>
On the authority of Abu Hurairah Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu said: The Messenger of Allah Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said:
</br></br>
"Whoever comes to the Jumu'ah prayer after performing ablution well, listens to the Khutbah silently and attentively, his sins are forgiven up to the next Jumu'ah and three additional days. And whoever touches the pebble (unnecessarily) has done a futile, void, abominable and reprehensible act."</br></br>
- Sahih Muslim 1873
</br></br>
Narrated Abu Hurairah Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu:
</br></br>
Allah's Messenger Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam(may peace be upon him) said: "On the day of Jumu'ah, when you tell the Muslim next to you to be silent, while the imam is delivering the sermon, then you have said a useless thing."
</br></br>
- Sahih Bukhari 934
</br></br>
May Allah grant us Tawfiq to abstain from all useless deeds during Jumu'ar.
(Ameen)

<h2 style="color: red"> In Brief and Details -</h2>

  <h4>Friday is a special gift to this Ummah</h4>
  Allah Ta'ala commanded the earlier nations, you should perform a special prayer for Me on the best day of the week. But they misjudged that better day. Thoughtfully the Jews chose Saturday for the worship of Allah and the Christians chose Sunday.  But the most respected day is Jummah (Friday).  Many virtues, many features of this day.  Allah Ta'ala has graciously granted that day to the Muhammadan Ummah.  Abu Huraira Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu Narrated, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said - </br></br> ❝
  نَحْنُ الآخِرُونَ السّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ، بَيْدَ أَنّهُمْ أُوتُوا الكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا، ثُمّ هَذَا يَوْمُهُمُ الّذِي فُرِضَ عَلَيْهِمْ، فَاخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ، فَهَدَانَا اللهُ، فَالنّاسُ لَنَا فِيهِ تَبَعٌ: اليَهُودُ غَدًا، وَالنّصَارَى بَعْدَ غَدٍ.❞ 
  </br></br>
 “We who come later will be the pioneers on the Day of Resurrection. But others (Anhusmani) have been given the Book before us. On this day (i.e. on one of the best days, all together and performing special worship) were made obligatory on them. But they disagreed. And Allah Ta'ala has shown us the right path to the right day. So in this case people are our followers. The best day of the Jews is Saturday, the day after Friday and the next day is Sunday.” </br> </br>
 - Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 876; Sahih Muslim, Hadith 855
  
  </br></br>
  In other words, in terms of coming to earth and possessing the heavenly book, my ummah Muhammad is lagging behind other ummahs. But we are the foremost in determining the day on which Allah commanded other nations for special worship. Just as we are ahead of everyone in determining the best and most beneficial day, so the Ummah of Muhammad will be the foremost among all Ummahs in terms of dignity, excellence and entry into Paradise on the Day of Resurrection.
</br>
In another hadith, the matter came like this - the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said - 

</br></br>

"Allah Ta'ala did not guide our previous Ummah regarding the correct day of Jumu'ah. As a result, it became Saturday for Jews and Sunday for Christians. Then Allah Ta'ala brought us and guided us on the correct day for Jumu'ah. So Allah Ta'ala (Honored Days) has fixed them like this - Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
</br>
(As others are our followers in determining the best day) so they will be our followers on the Day of Resurrection. We are the last to come in this world, but we will be the foremost on the Day of Judgment. On that day we will be judged before everyone else." </br></br>

- Sahih Muslim, Hadith 856;  Sunan Nasa'i, Hadith 1368;  Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 1083
  
  
  <h2>Five special virtues of Friday</h2>
  
  One of the excellences and dignity of Jumu'ah is that it is a silent witness to some of the great events that took place in history, which changed the course of the world or gave new life to the world.  Thus, the Great Deluge will take place on this day, which will end this mortal world and begin an immortal world.  Badri Sahabi Abu Lubaba Ibn Abdul Munzeer  Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu Narrated, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said - 
  </br></br>
  
  "Surely Friday is the ruler of all days. Friday is the greatest day in the sight of Allah. Even this day is greater to Allah Ta'ala than Eid-ul-Azha and Eid-ul-Fitr, the two Eid days of Islam.
</br>
There are five special features of Friday. On this day, Allah Almighty created Adam (peace be upon him). On this day he was sent from heaven to this world. Allah gave him death on this day. There is a time on the day of Jumu'ah, in which Allah will grant to the servant whatever he asks of Allah, unless he asks for something forbidden. Similarly, Qiyamat will also take place on Friday itself.
</br>
Even the nearest angels fear the day of Jumu'ah. The earth, the sky, the air, the hills, the mountains, the sea are all anxious on Friday (in fear of the Hour). 
</br></br>
-Musannaf Ibn Abi Shayba, Hadith 5559;  Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 15548;  Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 10841
  </br></br>
  In another hadith, Abu Huraira Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu narrated, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said - 
  </br> </br> 
  
  
  "Jumah is the best day of the sun that rises (i.e. the best day). On this day, Allah Ta'ala created Adam Alaihis Salam. He has been brought down to the world. He died on this day. His repentance has been accepted. Doomsday will take place on this day. There is no animal except man and jinn, which does not scream from dawn to sunrise on Friday for fear of the end of the Day of Resurrection. There is a time on Friday, if a Muslim prays to Allah at that time, Allah will surely give it to him." 
  </br>
  </br >- Muatta Malek, Hadith 291; Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 10303; Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 1046; Sunan Nasa'i, Hadith 1430; Sahih Ibn Hibban, Hadith 2772
  </br ></br>
  
  
<h2>  On the day of Juma, all creatures are afraid</h2> 
As quoted in the above two hadiths, on Friday all the animals are afraid that the Day of Judgment will be established on this day.  In another hadith, Abu Huraira Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu  Narrated, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said -
</br></br>


"There is no better day than Jumu'ah in the sunrise and setting days of the sun. There is no animal except man and jinn, which is not afraid of Jumu'ah (fearing the doomsday)." 
</br></br>
- Musannaf Abdur Razak, Hadith 5563; Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 7687; Musnad Abu Yala, Hadith 6468
</br></br> 


<h2>Friday is the leader of all days</h2> 
It is quoted in the hadith of Abu Lubaba Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu that surely Friday is the leader of all days. Friday is the greatest day for Allah Ta'ala. It is also mentioned in the hadith of Abu Huraira Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu that the greatest day is Friday. The matter has been mentioned in several other hadiths. Abu Huraira Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu. In another hadith narrated from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said:
</br></br>


"Jumah is the best day of the sun that rises. On this day Adam Alaihis Salam was created. On this day he was entered in Paradise. He was taken out of paradise that day. Doomsday will also take place on this day." 
<br></br>
- Sahih Muslim, Hadith 854; Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 9409; Jame Tirmidhi, Hadith 488
</br></br> 


Abu Huraira Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu Said, The Messenger of Allah, may God bless him and grant him peace, said:
</br></br> 

"Friday is the leader of all days. On this day Adam Alaihis Salam was created, on this day he was brought to Paradise and on this day he was taken out of Paradise. And the doomsday will take place on Friday." 
</br>
</br>- Mustadrake Hakem, Hadith 1026
<br></br> 
<h2>On the night of Friday, the deeds of the servant are presented in the court of Allah Ta'ala</h2>


Another feature of Friday is that on Friday the servants are presented to Allah Ta'ala. Abu Huraira Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu Said, the Messenger of Allah, may God bless him and grant him peace, said:
</br></br> 


"On Thursday night (i.e. Friday), the deeds of the child of Adam (in front of Allah) are presented. Then the deeds of those who break the ties of kinship are not accepted."
</br></br>- Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 10272; Al-Adabul Mufarad, Hadith 612
</br></br> 

<h2>Yaumul Majid of Paradise</h2> 

One of the special virtues of Friday is that it is a day of great joy and special achievement for the people of Paradise.  Every Friday in Paradise there will be a gathering of great joys and achievements.  In the special arrangement of Allah Ta'ala, there will be a meeting-festival of the Prophet-Messenger, righteous servants.  Above all, the people of Paradise will be blessed with the sight of Allah Rabbul Alamin, which is the highest blessing of Paradise.  So the angels remember the day of Jumah as 'Yawmul Ma'eed' which means the day of unique achievement.  Anas Ibn Malek   Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu Narrated, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said -

</br></br> 

"Jibreel Alaihis Salam came to me with something like a white mirror. A black spot on the mirror. I said, what is it? Jibreel Alaihis Salam said, This is the day of Friday. Allah has made this day an Eid day for you and your Ummah. So you are a pioneer from the Jews and the Nazarenes. (The days of their special worship are Saturday and Sunday respectively, which comes after the day of Friday.) The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, I asked, why was the day of Friday marked with black spots? 
</br> 

Jibreel (peace be upon him) replied, "The Day of Judgment will be held on this day." In the Hereafter we will remember the day of Jumu'ah as 'Yaumul Ma'eed'. 
</br>
The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, I asked, What is Yaumul Majeed?
</br>
Jibreel (peace be upon him) replied, "Allah has made a wide and fragrant valley in Paradise, and in it He has placed many mounds of white mesh." When Friday comes, Allah Ta'ala will descend on this valley. Then there will be pulpits of gold for the prophets, many chairs of pearls for the martyrs, and the hurrahs of Paradise will descend from their chambers. After that, everyone will continue to sing the praises of Allah Ta'ala and his greatness.
</br>
Gabriel (peace be upon him) also said, "Then Allah will announce, (O angels!) dress my servants in (special clothes). They will be equipped accordingly.
</br>
Then Allah will command, Serve (special) food for My servants. According to the instructions of Allah, special food will be arranged for them.
</br>
Then Allah Ta'ala will say, Present (special) drink before My servants. As such drinks will be served in front of them.
</br>
Then the command of Allah Ta'ala, apply perfume to my servants.  Then they will be blessed.
</br>
Now Allah will ask, (O my servants!) What do you want from me?
</br>
They will say, Our Lord! We only seek your pleasure and satisfaction.
</br>
Allah Ta'ala will answer, I have agreed with you. (In the narration of Tabarani, then Allah will open for them the door of such a blessing, which no eye has ever seen and no heart has imagined.)
</br>
Then Allah will direct everyone to go to their respective places. All will go to their respective Paradises and hurrahs will ascend to those chambers, each of which is made of green (precious gems) emeralds or red rubies." 
</br>- Musnad Abu Yala, Hadith 4228;  Muzame Awasat, Tabarani 3/55, Hadith 21054
</br></br> 

<h2>A'amol of Juma's Day</h2> 
The greatest deed of Friday is to perform the Friday prayer with utmost importance.  Being well purified and wearing clean and good clothes, going to the mosque early and engaging in prayer and dua-dhikr.  Then listen to Imam Sahib's sermon with concentration and perform Jumu'ah prayer properly.  This is the most important and most meritorious act of Jumu'ah.  Many virtues of this period have been mentioned in Hadith Sharif. 
<h2>One week's sins are forgiven</h2> 

Abu Huraira Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu  Said, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said -
</br></br> 

"Kaffara (expiation) for the intervening period (of sin) from one Jumah to another, if the Kabira is not sinned."
</br></br>- Sahih Muslim, Hadith 233;  Sunan Ibn Majah, Hadith 1086;  Jame' Tirmidhi, Hadith 414;  Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah, Hadith 1814 </br></br> 


Salman Farsi Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu Said, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said - </br></br> 

"Do you know what Friday is?
</br>
I replied, Allah and His Messenger know best.
</br>
He asked again, Do you know what Friday is?
</br>
I replied the same, Allah and His Messenger know best.
</br>
He asked the third time, Tell me what is the day of Friday?
</br>
I said for the third or fourth time, Jumah is the day on which Adam, peace be upon him, was buried. (i.e. He was created.)
</br>
Then the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, (None of this.) Rather, I am informing you about the news (of the true virtues) of Friday. If a Muslim walks towards the Jamah Masjid in purification, then remains silent until the imam finishes the prayer, then this prayer will be a expiation for his sins from this Friday to the next Friday, if the exterminators, the Kabirs, remain free from the sins." 
</br></br >- Sharhu Mushkilil Ashar, Hadith 3828;  Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah, Hadith 1732;  Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 23729;  Sunan Qubra, Nasa'i, Hadith 1677: Muzameh Kabir, Tabarani 6/237 (6089) Mustadrake Hakeem, Hadith 1028
</br></br>
Abu Saeed Khudri  And Abu Huraira Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu Narrated from, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said:

</br></br >

"A person who bathes on Friday, wears the best clothes he has and uses perfume if he has it, then attends Friday, does not leave anyone's shoulder undressed, then recites the Sunnah-Nafal according to Allah's Tawfiq, then refrains from going out for the Khatib (sermon). Remaining silent until he finishes the prayer, his prayer will be expiation (of sins) from this Friday to the next Friday."
</br>
</br>- Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 343;  Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 11768;  Sahih Ibn Hibban, Hadith 2778;  Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah, Hadith 1762;  Mustadrake Hakeem, Hadith 10465
</br></br>

Salman Alkhayer (Salman Farsi) Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu said, the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam said - </br></br>

"TWhoever performs ablution on Friday and purifies himself as best he can and uses his own oil or perfumes in his house, then goes out and does not leave a gap between two people, then  If he performs his prescribed prayer and remains silent during the Imam's sermon, then all his sins are forgiven for the period from that Jumu'ah to the next Jumu'ah."
</br>

</br>-Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 883;  Musannaf Ibn Abi Shayba, Hadith 5563
</br></br> 

<h2>Ten days of sins are forgiven</h2>

Allah Ta'ala has increased the scope of mercy and forgiveness.  He heard the announcement from the mouth of his Prophet, will forgive the sins of ten days because of the Friday prayer.  Abu Huraira Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu  Narrated, Rasulullah Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said -

</br></br> 

"A person who washes his head on Jumu'ah, then uses good perfume and puts on the best garment from his clothes, then goes out for prayer, (goes to the mosque together) does not sit between two people, then listens attentively to the Imam's sermon, that person The sins of one Juma'a to another and an additional three days are forgiven."
</br></br>
- Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah, Hadith 1403
</br></br>
In another narration, Abu Huraira Radiallahu Ta'ala Anhu  Said, The Holy Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said:

</br></br> 
"Whoever performs ablution well, then attends Jumu'ah, then listens attentively (to the sermon) and remains silent, his sins will be forgiven for the days between the two Jumu'ahs and three more days. And whoever touches the pebble has done in vain." 
</br></br>
- Sahih Muslim, Hadith 857;  Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 1050;  Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 9484;  Sahih Ibn Hibban, Hadith 1231
</br></br>
In short, it appears from these hadiths that the special practices of Jumu'ah are to take a good bath, wear the most beautiful clothes, wear perfume, listen to the sermon with concentration, not bother anyone in the mosque, do not let anyone go to the front, and do not do anything during the sermon. Not talking and not touching the stone and not doing anything useless.
</br>
Whoever performs the Friday prayer in this way, Allah will forgive his sins for one week, instead of an additional three days. May Allah Ta'ala grant us Tawfiq to do our deeds - Ameen. 
</br>



There are some other acts of great merit on the day of Jumu'ah. Some negotiations can be done with them at a later time, Inshallah. Allah Ta'ala is the Giver of Tawfiq and the Helper.
